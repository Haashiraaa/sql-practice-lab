# SQL Practice Lab

This repository contains my hands-on SQL practice projects as I learn and work with relational databases using PostgreSQL.

The focus is on understanding core database concepts such as:
- Creating databases and tables
- Inserting and managing data
- Running queries for analysis
- Developing safe and structured SQL workflows

Each practice project is organized into clearly separated folders for table creation, data insertion, and analysis to mirror real-world database work.

## Repository Structure

Each practice project follows a consistent layout:

This structure helps prevent accidental data duplication and keeps database operations clear and repeatable.

## Learning Goals

- Build confidence working with PostgreSQL
- Understand how databases persist data
- Learn safe SQL habits (separating creation, insertion, and analysis)
- Practice writing clean, readable SQL queries
- Prepare for real-world data analysis and freelancing work

## Tools Used

- PostgreSQL
- `psql` command-line interface
- SQL scripts executed from an editor

---

## Notes

This repository is a learning workspace.
Projects may evolve, be refactored, or expanded as my SQL skills grow.
